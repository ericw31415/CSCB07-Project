## Development Process

The CS Department Communication App was developed using Agile methodologies, specifically the Scrum framework. Ten user stories were created, five representing the needs of students and five addressing the requirements of administrators. These user stories were broken down into manageable tasks and organized into short, time-bound iterations known as sprints. Daily stand-up meetings facilitated open communication within the team, enabling prompt addressing of any roadblocks or adjustments needed to meet project goals.

## Project Management

Project management was carried out using Jira, a powerful tool that helped organize tasks, track progress, and manage the project's overall workflow.
